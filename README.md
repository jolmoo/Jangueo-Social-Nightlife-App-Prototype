# Jangueo – Social Nightlife App Prototype

**Jangueo** is a mobile prototype for a social nightlife application in Madrid, designed to help users discover events, manage their tickets, and connect with friends. The app was built as a front-end and basic back-end prototype to explore core social and event-related interactions.

## Overview

- **Purpose:** Prototype for a nightlife social app, including event discovery, ticket management, and user profiles.  
- **Scope:** Fully implemented front-end prototype; basic backend for content upload and data persistence. Advanced features like real-time maps and recommendations were planned but not implemented.  
- **Role:** Designed and developed the front-end UI and workflows; implemented a basic backend to support data storage and retrieval.
